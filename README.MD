# YLP Artist Friendly (Hopefully) Animation Tester

You can download Godot [here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/).

This is a simple test world where you can upload your frames and test how they look/feel. There is a world scene ```World.tscn``` and two player scenes in the ```Char1``` and ```char2``` folders. After opening up the project in Godot, you can swap between the characters in the world scene, and modify the sprites in the 2DAnimated Sprite Object to see how they work.
